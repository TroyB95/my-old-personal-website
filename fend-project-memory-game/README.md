## What is this?
This is a simple game of matching two of the same cards together. Once you have matched all the combinations on the board, you have won!

Try to complete this in the shortest time possible with the least amount of moves!

My personal record is 13 moves in 18 seconds! Can you beat it??

## Instructions
To play, click one of the cards on the board and then click another to try and find its pair!

Keep playing until you have matched all the cards on the board!
