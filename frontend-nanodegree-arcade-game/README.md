## What is this?
This is a 'frogger' type arcade game in which you have to try and make it over to the water without being hit by the enemies! There will be gems to collect along the way to increase your score! 

How long can you survive?
## Instructions
To play, enter what difficulty level you want to select and press ok! Then use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to move the player to avoid enemies and make it across to the river.

The idea is to make it to the furthest round possible with the highest score
